This version only works with the Frodo release of Xbmc. Gotham not tested but should work.

If you experience video problems after upgrading to Frodo from Eden then
it's probably caused by your HD Audio driver. You may need to re-install
your HDMI Audio drivers and make changes in Xbmc at 
Settings -> System -> Audio output

Frodo uses larger thumbnail images than Eden and XPanel and most TouchPanels
will struggle to show the images because they have to be rescaled. Images
are fine on iPad.
