= Note =

These download files are not hosted by Google Code. (This is due to a Google Code [http://google-opensource.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/a-change-to-google-code-download-service.html policy change].)

You can download the files below but I recommend that you use a Subversion client to download the latest version of the source code directly. (I use [http://tortoisesvn.net/ TortoiseSVN])
