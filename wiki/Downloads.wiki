  * These download files are not hosted by Google Code. (This is due to a Google Code [http://google-opensource.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/a-change-to-google-code-download-service.html policy change].)

  * For the latest version use a Subversion client to download the source code directly from https://code.google.com/p/xbmc-crestron/source/checkout. (I use [http://tortoisesvn.net/ TortoiseSVN])
