#summary Full instructions to get this project working on your system.

= Preliminaries =
  * Download and install a recent version of Xbmc. I suggest using the latest nightly version from http://sshcs.com/xbmc/
  * Switch on Xbmc HTTP server and event server:
    * From the Xbmc main menu navigate to System > Network
    * Select "Allow control of XBMC via HTTP"
    * Select both "Allow programs on this system to control XBMC" and "Allow other programs on this system to control XBMC"
  * If you suspect that a firewall is preventing you from communicating to Xbmc then open ports 8080, 9090 and 9777 on the Xbmc machine. Maybe first try disabling the firewall to see if that helps.
  * The VT Pro-e project requires at least version 4.2 of [http://www.crestron.com VisionTools]


= Compiling =
What follows are instructions for getting the demo XPanel project working. 
  * Download and extract the source code zip file from the Downloads tab
  * Open the xbmc-test.smw project file in SIMPL windows
    *  This project is set up for an AV2 processor. Change if required.
  * Locate the XBMC V2 module in the project. In the detail view, at the bottom of this module you will see 9 parameters:
    * `Item_Count`: is the number of items in a browse list that will be shown at one time. Minimum 1, maximum 10. Leave it at 6 for the XPanel project to function correctly.
    * `Name`: The name of the controller, as seen by Xbmc. Can be any string.
    * `Address`: The IP address of the Xbmc
    * `httpport`: The port that Xbmc's HTTP server is listening on (usually 8080)    
    * `tcpport`: The port that Xbmc's TCP server is listening on (usually 9090). This server does not have any authentication capability at present.
    * `Polltime`: The interval between polling Xbmc for currently-playing metadata. During playback the module also polls Xbmc every 2 seconds to get percentage completed.
    * `UseJpgExtension`: Usually this is set to 0. Xbmc thumbnails have the extension '.tbn'. Set this to 1 if you want the thumbnails to have extension '.jpg' instead. There is more information in the README in the download.
    * `Username` & `Password`:  set these parameters if you are using http authentication on your Xbmc server. It slows down the thumbnail retrieval.
  * Compile the project. If you get errors please email me.
  * Upload to your Crestron processor
  * Open and compile the VT Pro-e XPanel project. 
    * Be sure to set the IP address of your Crestron processor in the project properties (Ctrl-P)
    * Also, ensure the IP ID matches that for the XPanel in your SIMPL project
  * Run the XPanel and begin testing. If you notice errors in the Toolbox debug view please email me a screenshot.
