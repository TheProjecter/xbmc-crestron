=== Missing Details of Movies / TV Episodes ===

In order to view details of movies and TV show episodes I make use of 2 JSON methods (`GetMovieDetails` and `GetEpisodeDetails`) that were not part of the Dharma release of xbmc. They are in the latest xbmc source code which is now hosted at https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc.

These methods will be part of the upcoming Eden release.
