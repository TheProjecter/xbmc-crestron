#summary quick tips if it isn't working for you

=== Missing Thumbnails ===

The problem is usually the port number...

The JPGs are supplied by the Xbmc webserver directly, either port 8080 or port 80. The Eden version of xbmc uses port 80 but in the past it used 8080.

You can check the JPG port number in the Xbmc Network settings page. (See attached image)

In Crestron SIMPL project locate the XBMC V2 module in the project. In the detail view, at the bottom of this module you will see 9 parameters. Set the httpport to whatever port is on your Xbmc network setting page.

=== Missing Details of Movies / TV Episodes ===

In order to view details of movies and TV show episodes I make use of 2 JSON methods (`GetMovieDetails` and `GetEpisodeDetails`) that were not part of the Dharma release of xbmc but they are in Eden. Always use the latest stable version of Xbmc from xbmc.org/download/


=== Problems compiling Xbmc-Browse.usp ===

If you have problems compiling any of the modules for the MC3 then try:

  * Use "Recompile All" in the Build Menu. 
  * Try opening the Common_Functions.usl file in SIMPL+. 
  * On Windows 7 you have to run SIMPL+ as an administrator.
